## Sequences (#7)

Write a function `oddWithout1()` that creates an infinite sequence of positive odd
numbers that do not contain the digit `1` in its decimal
representation:

```text
3, 5, 7, 9, 23, 25, 27, 29, 33 ...
```

In `main()`, display on the console the sum of the first `20` elements of this
sequence.
